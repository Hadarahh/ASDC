This task concerns accessing JSON data and using it in your page. JSON data about some mother cats and their kittens is available in sample.json. The JSON is loaded into the page as a text string and made available in the catString parameter of the displayCatInfo() function. 


    Your task is to fill in the missing parts of the displayCatInfo() function to store:
    The names of the three mother cats, separated by commas, in the motherInfo variable.
    The total number of kittens, and how many are male and female, in the kittenInfo variable.
    The values of these variables are then printed to the screen inside paragraphs.


    The JSON data is provided as text inside the displayCatInfo() function. You'll need to parse it into JSON before you can get any data out of it.
    The last mother cat name should have an "and" before it, and a full stop after it

    Use a map to represent the information of only the mother cats

    Use a set to store the available breeds of the mother cats
